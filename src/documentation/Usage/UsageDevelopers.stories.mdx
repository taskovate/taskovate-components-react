###### GETTING STARTED
# Installing the Kit

> The Taskovate UI Kit uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) as the underlying JS framework.

The UI Kit provides developers with **React.js components, scss, css, html and assets**.

## 1. Create a React app

To kickstart your new project with the Kit, we do recommend to **generate a boilerplate React app** with the official [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) tool: you will be provided with a solid build setup with zero effort (that is, no configuration needed on your part). 
<!-- An example using the UI-Kit and create-react-app can be found [here](https://github.com/wfp/ui/tree/master/examples/create-react-app). -->

<!-- You can use the [Codesandbox template](https://codesandbox.io/xxxx) template to try out the Kit without installing anything. -->

<!-- An example implementation using `create-react-app` and `scss` can be found in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wfp/ui/tree/master/examples/create-react-app). -->

## 2. Add the Kit as a dependency

The next step is to **add the Kit to your project as a dependency**. You can choose to install it through `npm` or `yarn`: they are both valid package managers and we don't want to recommend one over the other, but once you pick your favourite tool, simply stick with it and avoid using them simultaneously.

To install the Kit through `npm`, run:

```bash
npm install @taskovate/ui --save
```

To install the Kit through `yarn`, run:

```bash
yarn add @taskovate/ui
```
